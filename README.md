# CardioLink
## Project Description
The project focuses on building a telemedicine application for remote supervision of patients with cardiac diseases, specifically arrhythmias and heart failure. These conditions require continuous monitoring of both symptoms and physiological signals to detect early warning signs and prevent severe events.
## Features
* ### Role-based Access Control
Differentiate user permissions and functionalities based on roles such as patient, doctor, and administrator each with specific permissions and access levels.
* ### User Authentication
Secure login system for user authentication and access control.


* ### Database Integration
Use of a relational database instead of plain text files.
* ### Data Encryption
Secure transmission of patient data using public-key encryption.

* ### Patient Client Application
Installed on the patient’s device for data reading and physiological monitoring.
* ### Hospital Server Application
Installed at the hospital, storing and managing data from multiple patients using a database.
* ### Doctor Application
Enables doctors to review and update patient information remotely.

## Users
* **Patients**: Symptom reporting form. Physiological Monitoring via Bitalino
* **Doctors**: Can log into the system and review patients’ symptoms and physiological records. Add or modify clinical notes.
* **Administrators**: Monitor server status. Secure shutdown mechanism which requires a password.
